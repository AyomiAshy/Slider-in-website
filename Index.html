              <h5 class="card-title">Solo Leveling</h5>
              <p class="card-text"> is a South Korean portal fantasy web novel written by Chugong and serialized in Kakao's digital comic and fiction platform KakaoPage starting on July 25, 2016.
                The story follows Sung Jinwoo, a notoriously weak E-Rank hunter who finds himself in a world where hunters, humans with supernatural abilities, must battle deadly monsters to protect mankind from certain annihilation.
                After narrowly surviving an overwhelmingly powerful double dungeon that nearly wipes out his entire party, a mysterious program called the System chooses him as its sole player and grants him the unique ability to level up in strength, something no other hunter can do.
               Jinwoo then sets out on a journey to discover the secrets of the dungeons and the true source of his powers as he fights against all kinds of enemies, both man and monster.
                The narrative explores themes of power, betrayal, and redemption, set against a backdrop of interdimensional warfare and cosmic manipulation.The story concludes with Jinwoo defeating the final antagonist, Antares, the King of Dragons and the Monarch of Destruction, and using the Holy Grail to turn back time, allowing him to spend 27 years in a temporal rift eradicating the Monarchs and their armies, effectively altering Earth's history.
                In the new reality, Jinwoo remains the sole bearer of immense power and chooses to stay on Earth, reencountering his schoolmate, Cha Hae-In, hinting at a semblance of normalcy and peace in a world once rife with conflict and chaos.</p>
